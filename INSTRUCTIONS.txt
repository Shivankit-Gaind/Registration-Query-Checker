                                                   INSTRUCTIONS

1. Most of the details about the implementation of the program is included in the code itself in the form of comments.
   The possibility of registration of a single course can be checked at a time.
2. 4 types of registration queries are included that can be tested:

  ----> register_For_PS1(STUDENT,L)
  ----> register_For_PS2(STUDENT,L)  
  ----> register_For_Higher_Degree_Course(STUDENT,L1,COURSE_NAME,L2,TIME_SLOT)
  ----> register_For_Course(STUDENT,L1,COURSE_NAME,L2,TIME_SLOT)

3. INPUT FORMAT

  (i) register_For_PS1(STUDENT,L)

      where 'STUDENT' is the name of the student and 'L' is the list of the course he has completed.
      example: register_For_PS1(jitesh,[c1,c2,c3,c4,c5])

 (ii) register_For_PS2(STUDENT,L)

      where 'STUDENT' is the name of the student and 'L' is the list of the course he has completed.
      example: register_For_PS2(jitesh,[c1,c2,c3,c4,c5])

 (iii) register_For_Higher_Degree_Course(STUDENT,L1,COURSE_NAME,L2,TIME_SLOT)

      where 'STUDENT' is the name of the student. 
     'L1' is the list of the course he has completed.
     'COURSE_NAME' is the name of the course.
     'L2' is the list of prerequisites of the course to be registered.
     'TIME_SLOT' is the slot in which the course is to be registered.
      Example: register_For_Higher_Degree_Course(jitesh,[s1,s2,s3,s4,s5,s6,s7,s8],s9,[s1],2-2).

 (iv) register_For_Course(STUDENT,L1,COURSE_NAME,L2,TIME_SLOT)
     
      where 'STUDENT' is the name of the student. 
     'L1' is the list of the course he has completed.
     'COURSE_NAME' is the name of the course.
     'L2' is the list of prerequisites of the course to be registered.
     'TIME_SLOT' is the slot in which the course is to be registered.
      Example: register_For_Course(jitesh,[s1,s2,s3,s4,s5,s6,s7,s8],s9,[s1],2-2).

4. INPUT FORMAT FOR 'TIME_SLOT' VARIABLE
   The format of time slot is: X-Y
   where X refers to the day number of the week
   and Y stands for the hour number.
   Example: 2-4 stands for Tuesday 4th hour(11 A.M. - 12 Noon)

5. VERY IMPORTANT: 
   
   (a) As soon as you register for a course, add a Predicate 'slot_booked(TIME_SLOT)' in the knowledgebase so that it can check for clashes
       if any one tries to register a course in the same slot.
   (b) Names of all the students and the courses have to be taken only from the lists provided in the knowledge base.  
   (c) Prerequisites of the course to be registered may or may not be present in the course structure list.
